Given any two integer quantities $a$ and $b$,
with $a > b$ say, we can ask what multiple (ie. what repeated addition) of
$b$ will give us $a$, or equivalently, into what multiple of $b$ can $a$ be
divided. For example, $6 = 2 \\times 3$ so six divided by three is two, and
$7 = 2\\times3 + 1$ so seven divided by three is two "with one over".
This is a basic notion
but its formal statement is important as it provides the foundation for the
`Euclidean Division Algorithm`_, `Euclid's Lemma`_ and `Bezout's Identity`_,
all of which are basic tools for studying divisibility and factorisation
in $\\mathbb{Z}$.

    **Theorem (Euclidean Division):** Let $a$ and $b$ be integers. If
    $b > 0$, then there exist $q, r$, also integers, such that

    .. html::

        $$
        \begin{equation}
        a = bq + r  \text{ where } 0 \leq r < b
        \end{equation}
        $$

**Proof [Cohn]** It is easy to establish the result using rational numbers:
let $q$ be $\\lfloor \\frac{a}{b} \\rfloor$ the largest integer not exceeding
$\\frac{a}{b}$, then

.. math::

    0 \leq \left(\frac{a}{b}\right) - q < 1

and so

.. math::

    0 \leq a - bq < b

Hence the number $r$ given by $r = a - bq$ satisfies $(1)$.

But rather than invoking raional numbers, the result can also be proved via
the Principle of Least Element (`Well-ordering`_). Let $S$ be the
set of all non-negative integers of the form $a - bn$. The set $S$ is not empty
- for example, take $n = -a^2$, then

.. math::

    a - bn = a + a^2b \geq 0

Therefore $S$ has a least element $r = a - bq$ say. By definition, $r \\geq 0$,
and so we must only show that $r < b$. Suppose on the contrary that $r \\geq b$,
then

.. math::

    r - b = a - bq - b = a - b(q +1)

which is an element of $S$ smaller then $r$, a contradiction. $\\Box$
