Basic Definitions
-----------------

Divisibility
::::::::::::

For non-zero integers $a$ and $b$, we write

.. math::

    a \mid b


and say $a$ **divides** $b$ whenever $a$ is a **factor** of $b$, 
which is to say

.. math::

    \exists k \in \mathbb{Z} \text{ such that } b = ka

Greatest Common Divisor
:::::::::::::::::::::::

The **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)** of two numbers is the largest positive
integer that divides both numbers. We write $gcd(a,b)$ for the GCD of
$a$ and $b$.

Primes
::::::

A **prime number** is an integer $p$ greater than $1$ whose only
positive factors are $p$ and $1$.

Two integers $a$ and $b$ are said to be **coprime** (or **relatively prime**)
and $a$ is said to be prime to $b$, if there is no integer other than
$\\pm 1$ dividing both $a$ and $b$.
For example $12$ and $25$ are coprime though neither is prime.
Clearly, if $a$ and $b$ are coprime, then $gcd(a, b) = 1$.

It may be said that a prime number $p$ is characterised by:

+ $p > 1$
+ $p$ is prime to all postive integers less than $p$

Note also that $a$ and $0$ are coprime precisely when $a = \\pm 1$.
This implies in particular that two coprime numbers cannot both be $0$.

Elementary Rules
::::::::::::::::

1. $c \\mid b \\text{ and } b \\mid a \\Rightarrow c \\mid a \\text{ (Transitivity)}$
2. $a \\mid a \\text{ for all } a \\in \\mathbb{Z}$
3. $\\text{If } a \\mid b \\text{ and } b \\mid a \\text{, then } a = \\pm{b}$
4. $b \\mid a_1 \\text{ and } b \\mid a_2 \\Rightarrow b \\mid (a_1 + a_2) \\text{ and } b \\mid (a_1 - a_2)$
5. $b \\mid a \\Rightarrow b \\mid ac \\text{ for any } c \\in \\mathbb{Z}$

Euclid's Lemma
--------------

Euclid's Lemma relates to an integer's prime divisors. First, a preliminary
theorem.

    **Theorem** Given two integers, $a$ and $b$, there exist integers $u$
    and $v$ such that

    .. math::

        au + bv = 1 \iff a \text{ and } b \text{ are coprime}

**Proof:** If $au + bv = 1$ for some $u$ and $v$, then $a$ and $b$ are
necessarily coprime, for any factor common to $a$ and $b$ must, by the
elementary rules above, also divide $au + bv = 1$ and so must be $\\pm 1$.

Conversely, if $a$ and $b$ are coprime, they are not both $0$, and therefore
the set $S = \\{am + bn \\mid m,n \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$ contains positive integers,
for example $a^2 + b^2$. Let $d$ be the least positive integer in $S$, say
$d = ax + by$, then the result follows if it can be proved that $d = 1$.

Divide $a$ by $d$ using the `division algorithm`_:

.. math::

    a = dq + r, 0 \leq r < d

Then

.. math::

    r = a - dq = a - (ax + by)q = a(1 -xq) + b(-yq) \in S
    
So $r \\in S$ and $0 \\leq r < d$ and $d$ is the least postive element
in $S$ by definition, therefore it must be that $r = 0$.
This means $a = dq$, ie. $d \\mid a$.

It can similarly be shown that $d \\mid b$, so $d$ is a common factor of $a$
and $b$, and therefore, since $a$ and $b$ are coprime, $d = 1$. $\\Box$

    **Theorem (Euclid's Lemma)** Let $p$ be prime and $a_1, a_2,\\dots,a_n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$
    such that $p \\mid a_1a_2\\cdots a_n$ then $p \\mid a_i$ for some $i=1,\\dots,n$.

**Proof:** We prove the contrapositive, ie. if $p \\nmid a_i$ for
$i=1,\\dots,n$ then $p \\nmid a_1a_2 \\cdots a_n$.

For $n=1$ there is nothing to prove, so begin with the case $n=2$. Let
$a_1$ and $a_2$ be given such that $p \\nmid a_1$ and $p \\nmid a_2$, we want
to show that $p \\nmid a_1a_2$.

Since $p$ is prime, it is coprime with both $a_1$ and $a_2$, and therefore by
the previous theorem:

.. math::

    a_1x + py = a_2u + pv = 1
    
for some $x, y, u,v \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, and so:

.. math::

    1 = (a_1x + py)(a_2u + pv) = a_1a_2xu + p(a_2yu + a_1xv + ypv)

which shows, again by the previous theorem, that $a_1a_2$ and $p$ are coprime,
and so $p \\nmid a_1a_2$ as required.

To demonstrate the general case use induction on $n$, that is, assume $n>2$
and that the result has been proved for values less than $n$. Now, by
assumption, we have that $p \\nmid a_i \\text{ for } i=1,\\dots,n$, and so:

+ $p \\nmid a_1$ and $p \\nmid a_n$ are given
+ $p \\nmid a_2 \\cdots a_{n-1}$ by the induction hypothesis

and it therefore follows by the already proven case $n=2$ that
$p \\nmid a_1a_2 \\cdots a_n$. $\\Box$
